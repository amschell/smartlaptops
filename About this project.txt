this is  a simple website for a small computer selling shop which i created using html,css and a bit of vannila js.
it has feutures like add to cart where the information about the order is sent to the sellers email adress.
it also has the "subscribe to newsletter" feuture where the subscriber's email adresses are saved to the sellers mailchimp account.
the latter feuture helps the seller advertise their products by sending advert emails and information about the latest products to the subscribed audience.
